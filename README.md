# 🚀 Magento Store Selenium Automation Project

## 📖 Project Overview
Magento Store Selenium Automation Project is a robust test automation framework designed to ensure the **reliability, security, and efficiency** of the Magento e-commerce platform. Using **Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Allure Reporting**, this project automates critical functionalities such as **user authentication, product purchase, order management, and wishlist handling** to improve software quality and streamline the testing lifecycle.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The primary objectives of this automation framework are:
- **Ensure functional accuracy and system reliability** by automating key Magento features.
- **Increase test coverage** across multiple scenarios, including edge cases and negative tests.
- **Reduce manual testing efforts** through automated regression testing.
- **Enhance reporting and debugging capabilities** using **Allure Reports** with detailed logs and screenshots.
- **Implement scalable automation practices** by leveraging the **Page Object Model (POM)** for better maintainability.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
The project is built using the following technologies:

| Technology/Tool            | Purpose                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Java**                  | Core programming language for automation scripts                                                |
| **Selenium WebDriver**    | Browser automation for functional and regression testing                                        |
| **TestNG**                | Test framework for managing test execution and reporting                                        |
| **Allure Reports**        | Generates detailed test execution reports with logs and screenshots                             |
| **TestNG Assertions**     | Validates expected vs actual results in automated test cases                                    |
| **Chrome Options**        | Handles browser configurations such as SSL, incognito mode, and notifications                   |
| **Maven**                 | Manages dependencies and builds the project efficiently                                         |
| **TestNG XML**            | Defines test execution flow and enables parallel execution                                      |
| **Page Object Model (POM)** | Encapsulates web element interactions for better maintainability using singleton design pattern |
